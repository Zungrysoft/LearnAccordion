                ItemBuilder is a datapack that allows Minecraft Java Edition mapmakers
                to create custom items using a system of effects and conditions. This website
                makes it easy to generate the give commands for those items. This site is mainly
                geared toward Complete-The-Monument mapmakers, but survival and adventure
                mapmakers will likely find this useful as well.
